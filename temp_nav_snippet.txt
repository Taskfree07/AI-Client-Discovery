This is a temporary file to help plan the navigation updates.

For manufacturing_icp.html, pipeline.html, and settings.html:

These files use the older style.css based navigation with:
- <ul class="nav-menu">
- <li class="nav-item">
- <a class="nav-link">

They need:
1. CSS added for .nav-group, .nav-group-header, .nav-arrow, .nav-submenu
2. HTML sidebar updated with collapsible Lead Engine group
3. JavaScript toggleNavGroup function added

The navigation should match the new collapsible structure but work within their existing CSS framework.
