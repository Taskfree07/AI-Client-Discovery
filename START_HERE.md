## 🎨 How It Works

### RAG Intelligence System

Traditional approach:
```
Search 500 → Enrich all 500 → Filter → 50 valid
Cost: 2,000 credits, Time: 2 hours
```

Our RAG approach:
```
Search 500 → RAG filter → 100 candidates → Enrich 100 → 50 valid
Cost: 500 credits, Time: 30 minutes
Savings: 75% credits, 3x faster!
```

### Validation System

Each lead scored on 6 criteria:
1. ✓ Manufacturing industry
2. ✓ 200-10,000 employees
3. ✓ Multi-location/multi-plant
4. ✓ HR + Operations teams
5. ✓ Regular hiring cycles
6. ✓ Uses staffing vendors

Valid lead = 4+/6 (66%+)
Excellent lead = 5-6/6 (83%+)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
# If install_rag_deps.bat fails:
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install chromadb>=0.4.0 aiohttp>=3.9.0
```

### Apollo API Issues
- Check API key in Settings
- Verify credit balance
- Check rate limits (10 requests/second)

### No Results
- Select more industries (increase pool)
- Lower min_validation_score to 3/6
- Increase company size range
- Check Apollo search parameters

### Slow Generation
- RAG should be enabled (default)
- Check console for errors
- Verify chromadb installed correctly

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small** - Test with 10/10/5 before scaling to 200/200/100
2. **Monitor credits** - Check Apollo dashboard during generation
3. **Review checklists** - Click "View Checklist" to understand scoring
4. **Filter by tier** - Focus on T1 (decision makers) first
5. **Export often** - Download Excel backup after each campaign
6. **Adjust thresholds** - Lower min_score if not hitting targets
7. **Use RAG** - Enabled by default, saves 75% credits
8. **Cache companies** - RAG stores for faster future searches

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### 1. Intelligent Pre-Filtering
Uses AI embeddings to filter candidates **before** expensive API calls.

### 2. Tier-Based Targeting
Not all leads are equal - prioritizes decision makers (T1) over practitioners (T3).

### 3. Validation Scoring
Every lead gets a quality score - no guessing if they're a good fit.

### 4. Production-Ready Output
Excel file is formatted and ready for CRM import - no post-processing needed.

### 5. Cost Optimization
RAG system reduces Apollo API calls by 75% - significant cost savings at scale.
